    "description": "You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n1st Round : Presence or absence of magical auras.\n2nd Round : Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.\n3rd Round : The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft ).\nMagical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.\nAura Strength : An aura\u2019s power depends on a spell\u2019s functioning spell level or an item\u2019s caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.\nLingering Aura : A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:\nOutsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.\nDetect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.\nSource PZO1134\nSchool divination ; Level bard 2, cleric 2, druid 2, inquisitor 2, magus 2, medium 2, mesmerist 2, occultist 2, psychic 2, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, spiritualist 2, summoner 2, witch 2\nThis spell functions as detect magic , except that you can glean much more information from the magical auras that you find, and those auras can be found after a much greater length of time. You can detect a lingering aura for up to 1 day per caster level you have, regardless of the aura\u2019s original strength.\nAdditionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell\u2019s area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster\u2019s aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature\u2019s caster level .\nFinally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell\u2019s aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge [arcana] check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster\u2019s set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell greater magic aura can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. Greater detect magic grants a saving throw against magic aura (but not greater magic aura ).\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue \u00c2\u00a9 2016, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Jesse Benner, John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, Robert N.

    "description": "Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound\u2019s basic character.\nThe volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a ghost sound receives a Will save to disbelieve.\nGhost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.\nGhost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.\nCan ghost sound create intelligible speech?\nMaking something that sounds like speech, and actually making intelligible speech are two different things. This spell can create sound that resembles people talking, but anyone listening carefully find they can\u2019t actually make out what the \u201cpeople\u201d are saying (imagine a crowded room with background conversations you can\u2019t focus in on). After all, it is a cantrip, and shouldn\u2019t be as good as ventriloquism (which is a higher-level spell).\n[ Source ]\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

    "description": "Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

Each rune illuminates a 5-foot cube, preventing any spell you cast of up to 3rd level and that has a defined area (as opposed to targets or an effect) from entering or affecting the 5-foot cube. For example, creatures and items within any square affected by peace bond take no damage from a fireball you cast. However, if you cast stinking cloud , the noxious vapors are an effect and enter such cubes normally. This spell does not break line of effect within any other spells you cast; it simply negates all effects of your 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-level area spells within the peace bond\u2019s area.\nPeace bond offers no protection against your spell-like abilities or supernatural area effects.\nPathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Street \u00c2\u00a9 2015, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Compton, Mikko Kallio, Nicolas Logue, Michael McCarthy, Mike Myler, and David N.

Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails. The DC for Strength checks required by this spell is equal to the spell\u2019s save DC.\nIf a target weapon is not currently sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, the weapon immediately attempts to sheathe itself, and its wielder must succeed at a Strength check to prevent it from doing so. Once sheathed or slung in this way, the weapon is difficult to draw, as previously noted above. Unattended weapons that are not currently sheathed or slung are anchored in place by the spell, and require a successful Strength check to pick up; each attempt requires a standard action . If the wielder doesn\u2019t have a sheath or sling available for the weapon, failure on the Strength check causes the weapon to fall to the ground, at which point it requires a Strength check to pick up, as with unattended weapons.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

    "description": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst , the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.\nSecond , the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person , command , and dominate person ). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus , using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar ), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.\nThird , the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell Resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.\nLevel cleric/oracle 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2 Target creatures touched\nThis spell functions like protection from evil , except you divide the duration in 1-minute intervals among the creatures touched.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat. \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

The object has no value and can\u2019t be used for other functions other than as an improvised weapon (for instance, this spell doesn\u2019t allow you to conjure an expensive spyglass and sell it or use its other abilities, but you could still use it to beat someone over the head). The conjured object can\u2019t already be a manufactured weapon, even in a location where you might expect to see manufactured weapons. It can be an object that would normally make for an unusual improvised weapon, like a herring at a fish market, and it still deals its full damage.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue \u00c2\u00a9 2016, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Jesse Benner, John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, Robert N.

Characters moving uphill (to an adjacent square of higher elevation) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square of steep slope. Characters running or charging downhill (moving to an adjacent square of lower elevation) must attempt a DC 10 Acrobatics check upon entering the first steep slope square. Mounted characters attempt a DC 10 Ride check instead. Characters who fail this check stumble and must end their movement 1d2 \u00c3\u0097 5 feet later.

Those who fail become entangled , but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The area of the spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC = the spell\u2019s DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter.\nThe spell can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. A creature holding a targeted item can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the spell\u2019s DC. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the item is unaffected. If it fails, the item is stuck in place. If an affected item is connected to another item (such as a sword in a sheath or a cork in a potion bottle ), it cannot be separated from the other item unless the creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check or a Strength check as a move action to free it (DC = the spell\u2019s DC).

A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can\u2019t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed .\nThe spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple , and to their CMD to avoid being grappled .\nSource Pathfinder Player Companion: Dirty Tactics Toolbox\nSchool conjuration (creation); Level bard 5, magus 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 5\nThis spell functions like grease , except as noted here.

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can\u2019t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can\u2019t be used untrained. This servant cannot fly , climb , or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.\nThe servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell\u2019s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

The spell doesn\u2019t teach you the language in question, but can be combined with tongues or a similar spell. Your body language and gestures mark you as a native of the culture, and you unconsciously make small decisions that help you blend in. Combined, these grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence members of the culture to which you have adapted, which doesn\u2019t stack with other circumstance bonuses you might possess by virtue of being a member of the chosen culture. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to pass yourself off as if you were a member of the culture, if you are not.\nThis doesn\u2019t provide benefits when disguising yourself as a specific member of the culture, though it negates any circumstance penalties you might otherwise have taken due to not acting appropriately for that person\u2019s culture.

The flashes are so brief that it is impossible to identify individual people or places, but when the target concentrates on a particular topic or individual, she can piece together a coherent narrative told in a multitude of changing voices in her mind.\nEach round for the duration of the spell, the target can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information as though she had spent 1d4 hours talking to local people. Since the information gathering doesn\u2019t involve actual interaction with people, only observation, the target can use her Perception skill instead of her Diplomacy skill. While thus concentrating, the target is effectively blind and deaf .\nPathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Street \u00c2\u00a9 2015, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Compton, Mikko Kallio, Nicolas Logue, Michael McCarthy, Mike Myler, and David N.

    "description": "This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target\u2019s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.\nThe spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person\u2019s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.\nSource PZO1134\nSchool enchantment ( charm ) [ mind-affecting ]; Level bard 4, mesmerist 4, occultist 4, psychic 5, shaman 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5\nThis spell functions like charm person , except that it affects a number of humanoid creatures whose combined Hit Dice don\u2019t exceed twice your level. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you reach the limit of HD you can affect. If you target only one creature, you ignore the spell\u2019s HD limit.\nFAQ\nCharm person makes a humanoid \u201c friendly \u201d to you, as per the rules found in the Diplomacy skill, but it also allows you to issue orders to the target, making an opposed Charisma check to convince the target to do something that it would not normally do. How does that work?\nThe charm person spell (and charm monster by extension) makes the target your friend. It will treat you kindly (although maybe not your allies) and will generally help you as long as your interests align. This is mostly in the purview of the GM. If you ask the creature to do something that it would not normally do (in relation to your friendship), that is when the opposed Charisma check comes into play. For example, if you use charm person to befriend an orc , the orc might share his grog with you and talk with you about the upcoming raid on a nearby settlement. If you asked him to help you fight some skeletons , he might very well lend a hand. If you asked him to help you till a field, however, you might need to make that check to convince him to do it.\n[ Source ]\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue \u00c2\u00a9 2016, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Jesse Benner, John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, Robert N.

In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated .\nIf you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2.\nWhile the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude . This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.\nA creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.\nSource : Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of the Beast\nSchool enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; Level bard 4, mesmerist 4, occultist 4, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4\nThis functions as hypnotism , except it affects 2 Hit Die of creatures per caster level you have. You can make up to five requests (instead of a single request) to each creature affected by the spell, and the requests can be as long and as complicated as you desire (though they still must be reasonable).\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

    "description": "You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.\nPCS:DR\nThere are some additional options related to this spell if a character has the Magic Trick feat :\nAlthough most spellcasters use floating disks as little more than a means of moving luggage, the shulsagas of the Astral Plane have mastered the ability to ride atop a floating disk. A combination of cultural importance, astral secrets, and constant practice allows shulsagas to push the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magic beyond its normal limits. Masters of the art can perform truly extraordinary maneuvers with proper training. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Magic Trick (floating disk) feat to use the trick.\nDefensive Disk ( Fly 3 ranks, Shield Proficiency ): While riding atop your floating disk with at least one hand free, you can spend a move action to grip the disk by its edge, tilt it, and use it to deflect blows. Until the beginning of your next turn, your floating disk grants you the benefits of the spell shield . If you are already under the effects of the shield spell from another source, this effect instead increases the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shield bonus by 1 until the beginning of your next turn.\nDisk Rider ( Fly 3 ranks): You can ride atop any floating disk you create, so long as it has the capacity to support your weight. This grants you a fly speed of 30 feet (average), but the disk cannot move itself or you more than 5 feet above the ground at any time. If you are on a location within the Astral Plane \u00e2\u0080\u0094the disk can instead fly to any height, and your fly speed while standing on it increases to 40 feet (good). When you cast floating disk, you can step onto the disk in your space as part of the action required to cast the spell.\nDrifting Defense ( Fly 6 ranks, Mobility , Shield Proficiency ): Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you can activate the defensive disk trick as a free action .\nExpanded Disk ( Fly 3 ranks, Heighten Spell ): If you are Large or larger, you can create a larger floating disk capable of supporting your weight and size; however, for each size category you are larger than Medium, you must use a spell slot that is one level higher (for example, a 4th-level spell is required to create a disk capable of supporting a Gargantuan creature). Once created, a disk augmented with this trick will always support the weight of you and your personal gear, even if this combined mass exceeds the disk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity.\nForce Check ( Fly 3 ranks, Catch Off-Guard or Improved Bull Rush ): When you successfully charge and bull rush a creature while riding atop your floating disk , you can veer the disk into your target, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage in addition to moving the target. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against any attack of opportunity attempted against you when performing a bull rush in this way.\nSpurn Gravity ( Fly 6 ranks): While astride your floating disk , you can fly higher than 5 feet above the ground. However, you must return to a location 5 feet above a stable surface before the end of your turn or fall. If you take damage from this fall, you fall prone atop your floating disk. As a swift action , you can also reduce the remaining duration of your floating disk to 1 round per level. For the remaining duration of the spell, your fly speed increases to 50 feet and your disk ignores all altitude limitations.\n\nThe disk created by this spell lasts for 2 hours per caster level and can carry up to 200 pounds of weight per caster level .\nThe disk accompanies you regardless of your speed, always catching up no matter how far you move. If you stand or sit on the disk, as a move action you can direct it to travel up to 30 feet in any direction.\nAny objects resting on the disk count as weightless parts of your gear for the purpose of teleportation effects (allowing these items to go with you when you teleport despite the weight limit of the teleportation spell).\nAs a free action , you can transform the plane of force from a concave disk into a bucket-like shape that holds up to 4 gallons (or transform it from the bucket-like form back to its normal disk form).\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object\u2019s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.\nIf the targeted item\u2019s own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), magic aura doesn\u2019t work.\nNote : A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.\nSource PZO1134\nSchool illusion ( glamer ); Level bard 3, mesmerist 3, occultist 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4\nIf cast on an object, this spell functions as magic aura , except that if you have identified the unique spellcasting signatures of a specific individual with greater detect magic or a similar spell, you can make the magic aura appear to have been created by that individual. Alternatively, you can simply obscure all identifiers, making it more difficult to determine who cast the spell. In either case, if the object is the subject of a greater detect magic spell, any Spellcraft check made to identify the unique spellcasting identifiers of the aura automatically produce the result you chose unless the observer disbelieves the spell with a successful Will save (as with magic aura , however, detect spells don\u2019t grant a save to disbelieve).\nIf cast on a creature, you can make that creature register to detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were the subject of any number of spells that you specify, when the spell is cast. Alternatively, you can make the creature register as non-magical, hiding all spell effects that he is currently affected by from such scrutiny. If you choose to make the creature register as being the subject of one or more spells, you can also alter the unique spellcasting identifiers of those spell auras, in the same fashion as described for objects.\nIf the target is a creature, you can also alter how the creature registers to arcane sight , making the creature appear to have or not have spellcasting or spell-like abilities , whether those abilities are arcane, divine, or psychic in nature, and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability they currently have available for use.

You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type.

The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.\nIf an attacked creature has spell resistance , you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level ) against that spell resistance the first time the shadow weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal.\nAt 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus .

    "description": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.\nFirst , the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.\nSecond , the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as charm person , command , and dominate person ). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus , using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar ), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.\nThird , the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects.\nFirst, the target gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects caused by technological objects and creatures with the robot subtype.\nSecond, the target immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any technological effects that exercise mental control over the creature, including the effects of pharmaceuticals. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on this saving throw, using the same DC as the original effect. If the target succeeds at this save, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to exercise mental control over her using technological means.\nPathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide \u00c2\u00a9 2014, Paizo Inc.; Authors: James Jacobs and Russ Taylor.",

If there isn\u2019t room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn\u2019t want or isn\u2019t expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target\u2019s square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell\u2019s total distance limit.\nReceiving : You can prepare an object ahead of time to apport it to yourself by casting the spell upon it and assigning a mental trigger to complete the spell. You don\u2019t need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.\nYou can\u2019t send or receive an object into a space that is protected by an antimagic field , globe of invulnerability , or similar effect that keeps magical effects out; if you attempt to do so, the spell is lost.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Occult Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2015, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, John Compton, Adam Daigle, Jim Groves, Thurston Hillman, Eric Hindley, Brandon Hodge, Ben McFarland, Erik Mona, Jason Nelson, Tom Phillips, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Thomas M.

    "description": "You summon a set of Small or Medium masterwork restraints into being. When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters ( manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints\u2019 key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell\u2019s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell\u2019s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target\u2019s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action , you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together.\nAs you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral , or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per dimensional anchor with a duration of 1 minute per caster level . If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints\u2019 hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points , and they can\u2019t be broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the dimensional anchor effect described earlier.)\nIf you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell\u2019s duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles. When this spell ends, the restraints disappear, and any ongoing effects created by the spell end.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Adventurer\u2019s Guide \u00c2\u00a9 2017, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Benjamin Bruck, John Compton, Crystal Frasier, Tim Hitchcock, Jenny Jarzabski, Isabelle Lee, Joe Pasini, Jessica Price, David Schwartz, and Josh Vogt.",

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn\u2019t cause you to become grappled.\nAnyone in the effect\u2019s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain . Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell\u2019s DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.\nIf you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover . If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.\nThe strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.\nWeb can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

If another creature dons the cloak during the duration, the cloak provides its protection and aid to the wearer, but it still uses the same bonus on the aid another actions as if you were the wearer.

    "description": "This spell creates an invisible magic field that does not stop weapons (whether manufactured or natural) from moving toward you, but impedes their motion when they are retracted. When you are hit with a melee attack, attempt a caster level check against your opponent\u2019s CMD . If your check succeeds, your opponent\u2019s attacking weapon or body part becomes caught in the field, as if magically affixed to your body. If your check fails, your opponent may retract its weapon.\nIf your opponent\u2019s melee weapon becomes trapped in the field, the opponent may release the weapon and move away from you. If your opponent attacked with a part of its body (such as a fist, a horn, a tail, etc.) or it attacked with a weapon but refuses to release it, your opponent gains the grappled condition. Because you are not using any part of your body to maintain control over your opponent, you do not gain the grappled condition.\nOnce an opponent\u2019s weapon is snared, you may attempt a new caster level check against that opponent\u2019s CMD on each of your subsequent turns to maintain the grapple . This is a standard action , during which you may make any of the usual grappling actions, but if you choose to pin the opponent, you gain the grappled condition as well. On your opponent\u2019s turn, it may try to retract its weapon or limb by attempting a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, the DC of which is equal to the spell\u2019s saving throw.\nWhile blade snare is active, you may make melee attacks and cast spells as normal, though you may not make ranged weapon attacks; the magic field thwarts such attacks. You may not snare more than one limb or weapon in the field at a time. If you already have an opponent\u2019s weapon or limb stuck in the field and you are hit by a second melee attack, you must choose which weapon or limb to snare . The other limb or weapon is unaffected by the spell.\nPathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods \u00c2\u00a9 2014, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Sean K Reynolds, with Amanda Hamon, James Jacobs, John Ling, Mark Moreland, David N.

    "description": "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster\u2019s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can\u2019t be defeated by dispel magic . Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can\u2019t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\nYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell .\nTargeted Dispel : One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell\u2019s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic , targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire ). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster ), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item\u2019s caster level (DC = 11 + the item\u2019s caster level). If you succeed, all the item\u2019s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding ) is temporarily closed. A magic item\u2019s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nCounterspell : When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u2019s spell.\n\nSchool abjuration ; Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 6, druid 6, inquisitor 6, magus 6, occultist 5, psychic 6, shaman 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6 , summoner/unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Domain liberation 6; Bloodline celestial 6; Elemental School void 6\nThis spell functions like dispel magic , except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.\nYou choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel , area dispel , or a counterspell :\nTargeted Dispel : This functions as a targeted dispel magic , but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\nAdditionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can\u2019t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse\u2019s DC.\nArea Dispel : When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic . For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\nFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster ) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\nCounterspell : This functions as dispel magic , but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u2019s spell.\nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell , roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2013, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Dennis Baker, Jesse Benner, Ben Bruck, Jim Groves, Tim Hitchcock, Tracy Hurley, Jonathan Keith, Jason Nelson, Tom Phillips, Ryan Macklin, F.

    "description": "All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature\u2019s Spell Resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil ), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies\u2019 Spell Resistance.\nThis spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a non-good called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding , planar binding , and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle . The creature cannot cross the circle\u2019s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u2019s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.\nA magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has Spell Resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its Spell Resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel ( astral projection , blink , dimension door , etherealness , gate , plane shift , shadow walk , teleport , and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature\u2019s extra-dimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle , but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\nYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\nA successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its Spell Resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram \u2013 even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\nThis spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa.",

You will use each die in the pool exactly once to customize numerological resistance .\nChoose one of the dice , and match its result to the appropriate value in the first column of the Eight Basic Energies table to determine the type of energy to which numerological resistance grants resistance. Next, allocate one of the dice to represent the number of creatures you can affect with numerological resistance (including yourself). All of these creatures must be within the spell\u2019s range. Then allocate one of the dice to represent the number of rounds numerological resistance lasts. Finally, sum the remaining two dice. This is the number of points of resistance that numerological resistance grants.\nThe Path of Numbers is a system of numerology that describes eight basic energies. Any of these types of energy can interact at any time, producing 64 possible combinations. It is believed that those 64 combinations are sufficient to describe the basis of every interaction in the cosmos. No matter the plane, creature, or time in question, every event in the multiverse is based on one of those 64 templates.

Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a dispel magic spell. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.\nNote that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.\nIf a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.",

Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles\u2019 CMB , the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.\nIf the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The black tentacles spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that black tentacles succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of black tentacles , for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.\nThe tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal.

When you are determining the tendrils\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CMB , the tendrils use your caster level as their base attack bonus and have a +13 bonus due to their Strength . Any tendril that succeeds in grappling a foe deals 4d6+13 points of damage to the grappled creature. Additionally, the tendrils created by this spell can detect evil auras, as if they had spent 3 rounds observing all creatures and objects within the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area using detect evil , and attack and impede the movement of only evil creatures, though they also attack any structures in their area. Each structure suffers a single attack each round; your caster level acts as the base attack bonus for these attacks, and the tendrils deal 4d6+13 points of damage on each successful attack. Creatures that lack evil auras are not attacked or impeded by this spell.\nAdd your tier to the base attack bonus of the tentacles. The tentacles also deal an additional 2d6 points of acid damage with a successful grapple .\nAugmented (6th) : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates twice as many tentacles in the same area, meaning each creature in the area is attacked twice per round.\nThe tentacles can grapple creatures that are immune to grappling if that immunity is from a non-mythic source, but combat maneuver checks to grapple such creatures take a \u00e2\u0080\u00935 penalty.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2013, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Dennis Baker, Jesse Benner, Ben Bruck, Jim Groves, Tim Hitchcock, Tracy Hurley, Jonathan Keith, Jason Nelson, Tom Phillips, Ryan Macklin, F.

A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed\u2019s fear aura for 24 hours.\nThe ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.\nThe mount is AC 18 (\u00e2\u0080\u00931 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 Hit Points + 1 hit point per Caster Level . If it loses all its Hit Points , the ghost wolf disappears. A ghost wolf has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider\u2019s weight plus up to 10 pounds per Caster Level .\nThese mounts gain certain powers according to Caster Level . A mount\u2019s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.\n8th Level : The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.\n10th Level : The mount can use\u00c2 water walk\u00c2 at will (as the spell, no Action required to activate this ability).\n12th Level : The mount can use\u00c2 air walk\u00c2 at will (as the spell, no Action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.\n14th Level : The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly Skill Checks equal to your Caster Level .",

This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness ). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as shadow evocation ) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion.\nIn addition, the rift created by shadow invasion has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When shadow invasion is dismissed as a standard action , there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton will be summoned under the caster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command (as per summon monster V ). This chance is 5% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of shadow invasion is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of shadow invasion would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Planar Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2018, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Robert Brookes, John Compton, Paris Crenshaw, Eleanor Ferron, Thurston Hillman, James Jacobs, Isabelle Lee, Lyz Liddell, Ron Lundeen, Joe Pasini, Lacy Pellazar, Jessica Price, Mark Seifter, F.

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.\nIf the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic , break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.\nIf the effect comes from a permanent magic item, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item\u2019s effects.\nAgainst non-mythic effects, the spell automatically succeeds without requiring a caster level check. Against mythic effects, add your tier to your caster level check. The maximum level of spell this spell can remove is 5 + half your tier.\nAugmented (7th) : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can apply A removed enchantment , transmutation , or curse to the creature that originally cast it.

    "description": "The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness as they animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning mithral blades that moves with you. Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the warding weapon spell. While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat. Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons. For example, if a 12th-level magus casts this spell using four +1 frost mithral daggers as focus, the damage dealt by the blades would be 6d4+1 plus 1d6 cold damage, as long as the daggers were commanded to be sheathed in ice. No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

Holding one\u2019s breath doesn\u2019t help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.\nUnlike a fog cloud , the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.\nFigure out the cloud\u2019s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.\nBecause the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.\nAs a move action , you can move the cloud 10 feet in any direction.\nAdd your tier to the spell\u2019s level and Hit Dice categories to determine its effect on creatures.

If the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser . A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it).\nThis movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature\u2019s normal movement.\nIn addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser \u2018s height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.\nYou can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that\u2019s smaller than what would be created by a full-height geyser spell.\nAdvanced Player\u2019s Guide .

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.\nThe chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are non-magical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.\nTo hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.\nLiving things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.",

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

    "description": "This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u2019t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance.\nYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the following table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\nFamiliarity : \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery familiar\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudied carefully\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you\u2019ve been there often. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeen casually\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cViewed once\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying .\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFalse destination\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\nOn Target : You appear where you want to be.\nOff Target : You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\nSimilar Area : You wind up in an area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall\u2019s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.\nUnlike a wall of iron , you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell\u2019s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.\nLike any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.\nIt is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone , provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.\nAn antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell\u2019s duration.\nSummoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an antimagic field . They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance , you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature\u2019s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)\nA normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals , undead , and outsider are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures\u2019 spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field.

Certain spells, such as wall of force , prismatic sphere , and prismatic wall , remain unaffected by antimagic field .

    "description": "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster\u2019s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can\u2019t be defeated by dispel magic . Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can\u2019t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect.\nYou choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell .\nTargeted Dispel : One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell\u2019s caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\nFor example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic , targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\nYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire ). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\nIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster ), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\nIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item\u2019s caster level (DC = 11 + the item\u2019s caster level). If you succeed, all the item\u2019s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding ) is temporarily closed. A magic item\u2019s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\nYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\nCounterspell : When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u2019s spell.\n\nSchool abjuration ; Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 6, druid 6, inquisitor 6, magus 6, occultist 5, psychic 6, shaman 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6 , summoner/unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Domain liberation 6; Bloodline celestial 6; Elemental School void 6\nThis spell functions like dispel magic , except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.\nYou choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel , area dispel , or a counterspell :\nTargeted Dispel : This functions as a targeted dispel magic , but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.\nAdditionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can\u2019t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse\u2019s DC.\nArea Dispel : When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel magic . For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.\nFor each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\nIf an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster ) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\nYou may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.\nCounterspell : This functions as dispel magic , but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u2019s spell.\nWhen used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell , roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2013, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Dennis Baker, Jesse Benner, Ben Bruck, Jim Groves, Tim Hitchcock, Tracy Hurley, Jonathan Keith, Jason Nelson, Tom Phillips, Ryan Macklin, F.

The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.\nFog : Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision , beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw : none. Spell Resistance : no.\nArcane Locks : All doors in the warded area are arcane locked . Saving Throw : none. Spell Resistance : no.\nWebs : Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw : Reflex negates; see text for web . Spell Resistance : no.\nConfusion : Where there are choices in direction- such as a corridor intersection or side passage- a minor confusion -type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw : none. Spell Resistance : yes.\nLost Doors : One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw : Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance : no.\nIn addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.\nDancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw : none. Spell Resistance : no.\nA magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw : none. Spell Resistance : no.\nA stinking cloud in two places.

    "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a wall of force . Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the wall of force first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level .\nWhen scribing a symbol of sealing , you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the symbol of sealing , but doing this extends the casting time as described under symbol of death (Core Rulebook 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned\u00e2\u0080\u0094the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.\nA disintegrate spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level . A knock spell has no effect on a symbol of sealing or its force wall. A symbol of sealing cannot be dispelled, but mage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disjunction automatically destroys it.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Magic . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

    "description": "You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.\nA wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall\u2019s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.\nIf you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.\nLike any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.",

    "description": "You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalls\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cceiling\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection , etherealness , or plane shift . You are considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery familiar\u00e2\u0080\u009d with your entire demiplane.\nAs a standard action , you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw . An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw . The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish , mage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disjunction, miracle , or wish and making a successful dispel check.\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nSchool conjuration ( creation ); Level cleric/oracle 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8; Subdomain greed 8; Bloodline astral 8, ectoplasm 8; Mystery elemental 8\nThis spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nAlignment : Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\nBountiful : Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\nElemental : Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait.\nGravity : By default a demiplane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.\nSeasonal : The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).\nShape : By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\nStructure : Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\n\nSchool conjuration (creation); Level cleric/oracle 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Subdomain solitude 9\nThis spell functions as create demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane or create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nEnergy : Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positive- dominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\nMagic : Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\nMorphic : You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal casting time , and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.\nPortal : Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).\nTime : By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp. If you have cast create greater demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Magic . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

    "description": "You create a dimensional link to the target creature.

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

    "description": "This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u2019t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance.\nYou must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.\nTo see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the following table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.\nFamiliarity : \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery familiar\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudied carefully\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you\u2019ve been there often. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeen casually\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cViewed once\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as scrying .\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFalse destination\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\nOn Target : You appear where you want to be.\nOff Target : You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\nSimilar Area : You wind up in an area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell\u2019s range, the spell simply fails instead.\nMishap : You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \u00e2\u0080\u009cscrambled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \u00e2\u0080\u009cMishap\u00e2\u0080\u009d comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.\nSchool conjuration (teleportation); Level psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Domain travel 7; Bloodline abyssal 7, arcane 7; Elemental School void 7\nThis spell functions like teleport , except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.",

    "description": "This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.\nYou know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura\u2019s power depends on a spell\u2019s functioning level or an item\u2019s caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (see tables above.) If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)\nIf you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.\nAs with detect magic , you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.\nArcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell.\n\nSchool divination ; Level psychic 7 , sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7\nThis spell functions like arcane sight , except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see.\nUnlike arcane sight, this spell cannot be made permanent with a permanency spell.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook . \u00c2\u00a9 2009, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn, based on material by Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams.",

    "description": "You summon one or more glossy black beetles, which have a measure of intelligence and make for excellent spies. When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action , provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can\u2019t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer.\nFor example, an insect is unable to relay someone\u2019s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.\nEach insects\u2019 size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity , +8 size ), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level , and can\u2019t make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment , and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level . The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth , possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures).\nYou also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are. As a full-round action , you can concentrate on the spell in order to learn the direction and relative distance of each of the insects.\nSchool divination ; Level druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 6, witch 7\nAs insect spies, but you can also borrow the senses of the summoned insects. As a move action , you can choose to receive sensory input from one of the insects, seeing what it sees and hearing what it hears. While doing so, you are treated as being blind and deaf .

    "description": "Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall- a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded by the colors for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall.\nThe wall\u2019s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.\nEach color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.\nThe wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancellation or a mage\u2019s disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall , but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed. Spell Resistance is effective against a prismatic wall , but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.\nPrismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell.\n* The violet effect makes the special effects of the other six colors redundant, but these six effects are included here because certain magic items can create prismatic effects one color at a time, and Spell Resistance might render some colors ineffective (see above).",

    "description": "You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalls\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cceiling\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection , etherealness , or plane shift . You are considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery familiar\u00e2\u0080\u009d with your entire demiplane.\nAs a standard action , you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw . An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw . The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish , mage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disjunction, miracle , or wish and making a successful dispel check.\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nSchool conjuration ( creation ); Level cleric/oracle 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8; Subdomain greed 8; Bloodline astral 8, ectoplasm 8; Mystery elemental 8\nThis spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nAlignment : Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\nBountiful : Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\nElemental : Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait.\nGravity : By default a demiplane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.\nSeasonal : The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).\nShape : By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\nStructure : Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\n\nSchool conjuration (creation); Level cleric/oracle 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Subdomain solitude 9\nThis spell functions as create demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane or create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nEnergy : Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positive- dominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\nMagic : Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\nMorphic : You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal casting time , and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.\nPortal : Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).\nTime : By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp. If you have cast create greater demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Magic . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.\nAny Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.\nThe walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid , strange chewing vermin , writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift\u2019s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid , bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift\u2019s walls have a Climb DC of 25.\nWhen this spell\u2019s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift\u2019s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.\nAt any time during the spell\u2019s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action . Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell\u2019s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via summon monster VII and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the rift of ruin spell. You can choose to summon one of the following: one bebilith , one vrock , 1d3 shadow demons , 1d3 succubi , 1d4+1 babaus , or 1d4+1 brimoraks.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Book of the Damned \u00c2\u00a9 2017, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Compton, Adam Daigle, Amanda Hamon Kunz, James Jacobs, Isabelle Lee, F.

You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the seamantle , but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC , +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have freedom of movement effects. The cover granted by the seamantle does not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as cloudkill ).\nThe seamantle blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the seamantle ; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes as a bubble of steam contained within the seamantle rather than its usual effect.\nThe seamantle allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action , you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch.\nYou automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as dispel magic ; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as flame blade , flaming sphere , or incendiary cloud ). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A flaming or flaming burst weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.\nAdvanced Player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide .

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

    "description": "Trap the soul forces a creature\u2019s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.\nDepending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.\nSpell Completion : First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows Spell Resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature\u2019s name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or Spell Resistance is successful, the gem shatters.\nTrigger Object : The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature\u2019s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature\u2019s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.",

    "description": "This spell creates a vertical wall of lava that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A wall of lava \u2018s maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a wall of lava can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall\u2019s overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava , it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack).\nA creature can move through a wall of lava as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a wall of lava inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A wall of lava also radiates heat as if it were a wall of fire , although the heat from a wall of lava radiates from both sides.\nOnce per round as a move action , you can direct the wall of lava to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall\u2019s overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a wall of lava from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.\nAll damage inflicted by physical contact with a wall of lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).\nAdvanced Player\u2019s Guide .

Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.\nIn order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.\nIf an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist.

    "description": "A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.\nYou may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion , your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal , dominate person , or dominate monster , your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant\u2019s level, provided that the spell\u2019s target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants\u2019 spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants\u2019 spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.\nRegardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\u2019t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\nIf you cast any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell\u2019s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature\u2019s save succeeds, all binding spells it has received are broken.\nThe binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\nChaining : The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.\nSlumber : This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell\u2019s save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.\nBound Slumber : This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.\nHedged Prison : The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.\nMetamorphosis : The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\nMinimus Containment : The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\nYou can\u2019t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or mage\u2019s disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by dismissal , banishment , or a similar effect.",

If you ask the creature to do something that it would not normally do (in relation to your friendship), that is when the opposed Charisma check comes into play. For example, if you use charm person to befriend an orc , the orc might share his grog with you and talk with you about the upcoming raid on a nearby settlement. If you asked him to help you fight some skeletons , he might very well lend a hand. If you asked him to help you till a field, however, you might need to make that check to convince him to do it.\n[ Source ]",

    "description": "You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no actual substance and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect. Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level.\nSpells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature\u2019s ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.\nThe wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight. Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the wall of suppression . The wall does not affect artifacts, anything stemming from the direct action of a deity, or similarly powerful sorts of magic.\nAdvanced Player\u2019s Guide .

    "description": "The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources.\nIf the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you\u2019re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn\u2019t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.\nYou perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don\u2019t find them disorienting.\nWhen you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, You can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can\u2019t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action , you couldn\u2019t take a standard or move action . Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn\u2019t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action .\nThe two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same fireball , you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by hold person , both would become paralyzed on a failed save.\nBoth bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can\u2019t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover . However, you don\u2019t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.\nAny magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you\u2019re bilocating. For example, the hold person spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds\u2019 worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared.\nIf you were under an eagle\u2019s splendor effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast bilocation, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.\nWhen the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Occult Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2015, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, John Compton, Adam Daigle, Jim Groves, Thurston Hillman, Eric Hindley, Brandon Hodge, Ben McFarland, Erik Mona, Jason Nelson, Tom Phillips, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Thomas M.

The clashing rocks appear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The clashing rocks ignore concealment and cover , and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the clashing rocks , the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the clashing rocks takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone . If the target fails a Reflex Saving Throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in .\nIf the clashing rocks miss the target, the target still takes 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage from falling rocks and is knocked prone . A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the clashing rocks appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing).

    "description": "You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalls\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cceiling\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.\nThere are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use move earth to create a hill or wall of stone to create a barricade.\nWhen you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as astral projection , etherealness , or plane shift . You are considered \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery familiar\u00e2\u0080\u009d with your entire demiplane.\nAs a standard action , you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw . An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw . The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using limited wish , mage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disjunction, miracle , or wish and making a successful dispel check.\nIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by casting the spell again to create a linked area between the two.\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast create lesser demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nSchool conjuration ( creation ); Level cleric/oracle 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8; Subdomain greed 8; Bloodline astral 8, ectoplasm 8; Mystery elemental 8\nThis spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove) one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nAlignment : Your plane gains the (mildly) chaos-, good-, evil-, law-, or neutral-aligned alignment trait (see Alignment Traits). You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\nBountiful : Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants. The demiplane provides enough plant-based food (nuts, grains, fruit, fungi, and so on) to support one Medium creature for every 10-foot cube of the demiplane. The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner. If your demiplane has ambient light, these plants are normal, familiar surface plants; if it is a realm of twilight or darkness, these plants are fungi and other plants adapted to near-darkness or underground locations.\nElemental : Your plane gains the air-, earth-, fire-, or water- elemental dominant trait.\nGravity : By default a demiplane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is normal and oriented in one direction, like what most creatures are used to on the Material Plane. By selecting this feature, the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity is heavy, light, none, objectively directional, or subjectively directional.\nSeasonal : The demiplane has a seasonal cycle and a light cycle, usually similar to those of a land on the Material Plane, but customizable as you see fit (for example, your demiplane could always be winter, day and night could alternate every 4 hours, and so on).\nShape : By default, the demiplane has a fixed shape and borders. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.\nStructure : Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp. If you have cast create demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\n\nSchool conjuration (creation); Level cleric/oracle 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Subdomain solitude 9\nThis spell functions as create demiplane, except the area is larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a demiplane you created with lesser create demiplane or create demiplane (you do not need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell, in which case it has an instantaneous duration.\nEnergy : Your plane gains the (minor) negative- or positive- dominant energy trait. A plane cannot have both the negative-dominant and positive-dominant energy traits.\nMagic : Your plane gains the dead magic, enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait. If you selected dead magic, you are trapped within your plane unless it has a permanent planar portal (such as the portal feature, below). If you selected enhanced or impeded magic, choose one type of magic to be enhanced or impeded, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ceffects with the fire descriptor or that manipulate fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath spells and spells from the Death or Repose domains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.\nMorphic : You may use move earth at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal casting time , and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.\nPortal : Your demiplane gains a permanent gate to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you. This gate is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).\nTime : By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane. By selecting this feature, you may make your plane have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait (see Time).\nYou can make this spell permanent with the permanency spell, at a cost of 22,500 gp. If you have cast create greater demiplane multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s area requires its own permanency spell.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Magic . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

    "description": "Casting a gate spell has two effects.\nFirst, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.\nSecond, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate .\nThe gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster\u2019s choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.\nA gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.\nPlanar Travel : As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you\u2013anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.\nYou may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.\nCalling Creatures : The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate , although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.\nIf you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can\u2019t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\nIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in \u201clivestock\u201d rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.\nNote : When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.",

    "description": "This spell works like maze , except the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the maze a different effect occurs depending on which section of the maze it is in. Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the maze to see which part of the maze it wanders through; if a creature doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if the creature exits the maze before then, but conditions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stack with themselves.\nCircus : The creature finds itself in a nightmarish circus of giant beasts, garishly painted faces, and hideous, mocking laughter. The creature must succeed at a Will save or gain a lesser madness. The save uses the madness\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal DC.\nHaunted Forest : The creature travels through a dark forest of grasping trees while shadowy beasts prowl at the edge of its vision. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the maze, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 branches.\nHellscape : The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to escape the maze while paralyzed , and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis , the hellscape delivers a coup de grace , dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.\nOasis of Respite : Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the maze is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the maze. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to escape the maze while fascinated . A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the maze, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per maze ).\nStrange City : The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage . If your campaign uses the sanity rules , the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Horror Adventures \u00c2\u00a9 2016, Paizo Inc.; Authors: John Bennett, Clinton J.

    "description": "This spell creates a towering mansion. While casting the spell, you hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and is decorated to match your image. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally.\nA resplendent mansion contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as a mage\u2019s magnificent mansion .\nEach of the mansion\u2019s exterior doorways and windows are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each alarm is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each alarm has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.\nThe mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting all structural requirements for being built on, for example, a mountainside. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can\u2019t be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there\u2019s a 10% chance each day that the mansion begins to sink or collapse.\nThe mansion doesn\u2019t harm creatures within the area when it appears, and can\u2019t be created among a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the mansion when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete mansion.\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Intrigue \u00c2\u00a9 2016, Paizo Inc.; Authors: Jesse Benner, John Bennett, Logan Bonner, Robert Brookes, Jason Bulmahn, Ross Byers, Robert N.

    "description": "This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider , elemental , or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster . You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.\nA summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as wish ).\nWhen you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template , if you are good, and the fiendish template , if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell\u2019s type match your alignment.\nThe summon monster spells have numerous entries representing creatures that are summoned from the Outer Planes, and thus have the celestial or fiendish template or can be summoned with the entropic or resolute template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, pages 292 and 293, respectively).\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 2, bard 2, cleric/oracle 2, medium 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, spiritualist 2, witch 2; Subdomain dark tapestry 2; Elemental School air 2, earth 2, fire 2, water 2\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 3, bard 3, cleric/oracle 3, psychic 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, spiritualist 3, witch 3\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list .\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level antipaladin 4, bard 4, cleric/oracle 4, medium 3, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4; Elemental School air 4, earth 4, fire 4, water 4\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 5, cleric/oracle 5, medium 4, psychic 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, spiritualist 5, summoner / unchained summoner 4, witch 5; Domain darkness 5; Subdomain dark tapestry 5; Elemental School air 5, earth 5, fire 5, water 5; Mystery flame 5\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level bard 6, cleric/oracle 6, psychic 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, spiritualist 6, unchained summoner 5, witch 6; Elemental School air 6, earth 6, fire 6, water 6\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 7, psychic 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, summoner 5, unchained summoner 6, witch 7; Bloodline aquatic 7; Elemental School air 7, earth 7, fire 7, water 7\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 8, psychic 8, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8;\u00c2 Bloodline elemental 8; Elemental School air 8, earth 8, fire 8, water 8\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nSchool conjuration (summoning); Level cleric/oracle 9, psychic 9, sorcerer/wizard 9, witch 9; Domain chaos 9, evil 9, good 9, law 9; Bloodline abyssal 9\nThis spell functions like summon monster I , except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list , 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list , or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.\nMany adventure paths include custom summoning options for characters who follow certain gods, or must meet other special requirements (such as only being available to members of certain races).\nLike any other optional rules, players should always consult their GM to see if they are approved for use.

    "description": "You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land-you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round-on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round.\nCreatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage).\nIn addition, the tsunami makes a special CMB check against any creature it strikes-the wave\u2019s CMB is equal to your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability score modifier (whichever is highest) + 8 (for the wave\u2019s size). If this CMB check defeats a creature\u2019s CMD , the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave\u2019s CMB check-if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage ( Fortitude save for half ) and continues being carried along by the wave.\nObjects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave\u2019s journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space-if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.\nA solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.\nAdvanced Player\u2019s Guide .

Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed .

When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select.

Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere\u2019s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target\u2019s space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.\nOnce a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.\nThis spell can start fires on a ship.",

    "description": "By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.\nYou project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.\nWhile you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\nYou and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).\nWhen this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.\nSchool necromancy ; Level cleric/oracle 5, sorcerer/wizard 5\nThis spell functions as astral projection , except you cannot leave the Astral Plane and explore other planes (though you can still return to the plane you were on when you cast this spell).\nPathfinder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Magic . \u00c2\u00a9 2011, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Bulmahn, Tim Hitchcock, Colin McComb, Rob McCreary, Jason Nelson, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Sean K Reynolds, Owen K.C.

Anyone holding one of the jars can communicate with the mummy as if they share a common language. The bearer gains the benefits of protection from evil and sanctuary, but only against that mummy.\nUnsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a suggestion spell ( Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an effect similar to geas ( Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable.\nPathfinder Companion: Osirion, Land of Pharaohs, Copyright 2008, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Authors: Jason Nelson and Todd Stewart.",

    "description": "You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave\u2019s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.\nWhen you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).\nThe wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM\u2019s discretion.\nThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave\u2019s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.\nThe momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).\nYou can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.\nAdvanced Player\u2019s Guide . Copyright 2010, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Jason Bulmahn.",

(The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM\u2019s discretion.)\nDuplicated spells allow saves and Spell Resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).\nWhen a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).",
