tests/test_conditions.py

This module tests the conditions framework for our Pathfinder simulation.
It verifies that each condition:
  - Returns the correct modifiers and skill penalties as defined in the configuration.
  - Ticks down its duration correctly and expires when expected.
  - Properly affects or does not affect a characterâ€™s effective skill modifiers.
  
Each test case is documented with clear explanations.
