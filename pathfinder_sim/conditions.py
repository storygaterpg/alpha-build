--------------

This module implements the conditions framework for our Pathfinder simulation.
Each condition is defined as a subclass of the base Condition class. Each condition
has a name, duration (in rounds), and a detailed description that covers both its explicit
mechanical effects and its implicit (selfâ€‘explanatory) effects.

Currently implemented conditions include:
  - BlindedCondition
  - ConfusedCondition
  - ProneCondition
  - ShakenCondition
  - StunnedCondition

Additional conditions can be added following this pattern.
