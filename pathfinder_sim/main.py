-------

This is the main simulation engine for our Pathfinder 1st Edition game.
This updated version creates a more complex simulation environment that tests multiple aspects:
  - A larger game map with varied terrain.
  - Multiple characters with multiclass progression.
  - Conditions affecting AC and skills.
  - A multi-turn loop that processes diverse actions (movement, attack, spell, skill check).
  - Logging and state updates for DM justification.
